Kotlin DSL for making slideshows.

## This project is under mit-0, so you don't need to include author notice, it would be kind if you did, but again you don't need to.

# BUT!

## This project uses apache poi which you need to include their licensing stuff, for more info go [here](https://poi.apache.org/legal.html).

## If jvm sourceset is not used then poi is not used so you don't need to do their licensing stuff.
